# Defect Item List Generator

Purpose: To generate a formated excel file without hassle.

Usage:
1. Create a parent directory as the source folder.
2. Create sub directory inside the created source folder. (Each sub directory is equivalent to an item or a row)
3. Save the images into the sub directory.(Only accept 4 images for one row, image extension is restricted to .jpg only)
4. Save a .txt file for each sub directory. Inside the txt file, 1 line is equivalent to 1 description for 1 image.

*Step 3 and 4 are optional.
<br>
*Image order is followed by the name in ascending order.
<br>
*Lines in txt file are first come first serve.If you want a description for the first image in this directory, put it as the first line in the txt file.

Future to-do list: (Whole project may be abandoned tho)
1. Accept all image extention.
2. Infinite image in one row and the format should change accordingly.
